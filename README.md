# Stock_Price_with_ML

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict stock market trends by integrating historical stock price data with sentiment analysis of financial news. The project is divided into multiple phases, covering data collection, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and preparation of research findings.

## Project Phases and Timeline

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing (Week 1)
**Objectives:**
- Collect historical stock price data and financial news articles.
- Preprocess the data for analysis and modeling.

**Tasks:**
1. **Data Collection:**
    - **Stock Price Data:**
        - Apple (AAPL)
        - Tesla (TSLA)
        - JPMorgan (JPM)
        - Pfizer (PFE)
        - ExxonMobil (XOM)
        - Use APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl.
    - **Sentiment Data:**
        - Scrape news articles or social media posts using BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or NewsAPI.
        - Ensure data is collected over the same period as stock prices.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - **Stock Price Data:**
        - Handle missing values, normalize data, create features like moving averages and daily returns.
    - **Sentiment Data:**
        - Clean text data, perform tokenization, stemming/lemmatization.
        - Calculate sentiment scores using VADER, TextBlob, or Transformers.

**Deliverables:**
- Cleaned and preprocessed datasets for stock prices and sentiment analysis.

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering (Week 2)
**Objectives:**
- Extract meaningful features for modeling.

**Tasks:**
1. **Financial Features:**
    - Calculate technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD).
    - Compute features like volatility and volume.
2. **Sentiment Features:**
    - Aggregate sentiment scores by day, week, or month.
    - Explore sentiment analysis techniques (e.g., VADER, BERT).
    - Consider additional NLP features like word embeddings.
3. **Temporal Features:**
    - Include time-related features (e.g., day of the week, month).

**Deliverables:**
- Feature matrix combining financial, sentiment, and temporal features.

### Phase 3: Model Implementation and Training (Weeks 3-4)
**Objectives:**
- Implement and train machine learning models.

**Tasks:**
1. **Model Selection:**
    - Start with Linear Regression and Decision Trees.
    - Progress to Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks (LSTM, GRU).
2. **Model Training:**
    - Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
    - Train models, tune hyperparameters, and implement time series cross-validation.
3. **Modeling Considerations:**
    - Handle time-series data (e.g., data stationarity, sequence length for LSTM).
    - Use ensemble methods if needed.

**Deliverables:**
- Trained models and initial performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, accuracy).

### Phase 4: Model Evaluation and Optimization (Week 5)
**Objectives:**
- Evaluate and optimize model performance.

**Tasks:**
1. **Evaluation Metrics:**
    - Calculate RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and accuracy.
    - Assess model generalization using the test set.
2. **Model Optimization:**
    - Fine-tune hyperparameters using Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization.
    - Perform feature selection and engineering.
    - Consider model integration or ensemble techniques.
3. **Error Analysis:**
    - Analyze model errors and investigate improvements.

**Deliverables:**
- Finalized models with optimized parameters and detailed evaluation metrics.

### Phase 5: Research Paper and Presentation Preparation (Week 6)
**Objectives:**
- Document findings and prepare for presentation.

**Tasks:**
1. **Research Paper Writing:**
    - **Introduction:** Background, objectives, and significance.
    - **Data and Methodology:** Data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.
    - **Results:** Model evaluation metrics and comparisons.
    - **Discussion:** Interpretation of results, limitations, and improvements.
    - **Conclusion:** Summary of findings and future work.
2. **Presentation Preparation:**
    - Create visualizations for key findings.
    - Prepare a slide deck summarizing the project.
    - Practice presentation skills.

**Deliverables:**
- Research paper ready for submission.
- Presentation ready for delivery.

## Key Considerations and Tips
1. **Data Quality:** Ensure accuracy and relevance of financial and sentiment data.
2. **Model Interpretability:** Choose models that are interpretable for non-technical audiences.
3. **Stay Updated:** Follow the latest research and techniques in financial prediction and sentiment analysis.
4. **Document Everything:** Maintain detailed documentation for all steps to support the research paper and presentation.

This project will provide valuable insights into stock market prediction using a combination of financial data and sentiment analysis, showcasing advanced skills in data science and machine learning.
